The color of an object can be discovered by looking at that object. Visible means able to be seen. To see means to look. Black is a kind of color. Spotted is a kind of color pattern. Coloration means a pattern of colors. The color of or coloration of fur is an inherited characteristic. Trait is synonymous with characteristic. Leopard is a kind of animal. An animal is a kind of living thing. A living thing is a kind of object. Fur is often part of an animal. Coat means fur coat. Cub is a kind of offspring. To breed is similar to to reproduce.
